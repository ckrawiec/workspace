Section 1
Basics of gravitational lensing

An object on the sky is gravitationally lensed when it passes behind another object.
A light ray from the background object follows an altered path due to the gravitational potential of the foreground one.
From an observer's perspective, the background object does not appear as it would unlensed - its observed position, size, and shape are altered.
The way these are altered depends on the nature of the foreground object's gravitational potential, which in turn depends on its mass distribution.
Thus, the mass distributions of bodies in the universe can be deduced using gravitational lensing. #- using images of distant galaxies?
#change object to body?

The formulas used to describe the bending of light due to a massive body are similar to those used in regular optics.
The background object is be referred to as the ``source'', and the foreground object the ``lens''.

Because the distances between the bodies involved in lensing are much larger than the distance along which lensing occurs, the three-dimensional mass distributions can be approximated as two-dimensional planes, the source plane and the lens plane. (meneghetti pg 17)

The mass distribution responsible for lensing is expressed as the surface mass density - the integral of the three-dimensional density along the line of sight. #(los)

Systematic vs. Statistical errors

The key problem here is that lensing is not the only process by which galaxy properties become correlated. Galaxies at the same redshift can be aligned because of physical entanglements. Their shape and size can also be affected at the time of observation as well. Telescopic and atmospheric effects can produce spurious ellipticities that are correlated within the image, but are not truly correlated on the sky.
