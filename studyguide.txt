Why do I care?
Dark energy is one of the great mysteries of the universe
What is it?
-the universe is accelerating and we do not know why
-cosmological constant
How can we learn about dark energy?
-growth of structure over time
-w
How can we measure evolution of matter?
-mass distribution of dark matter halos
-use gravitational lensing to measure masses
-using different redshift bins can give tomography
-correlation functions carry information about?
	     -matter density power spectrum (references??)

What else can we learn?
-cosmology from correlation functions
-galaxy bias?

How to measure mass from lensing?
-surface mass density
-shear (read some shear papers)
-kappa from magnification

What is magnification?
-lensing changes source flux and size
-surface brightness is conserved
-number of sources at given flux is changed
	-observed luminosity function depends on slope of intrinsic luminosity function

What should we use as lenses and sources?
-Want cleanly separated samples
      -no physical correlations, only lensing
-want a large sample so S/N is good

Why use LBGs?
-the lyman break makes these galaxies easier to select
-very high redshift (z>4)
-will be cleanly separated from lens sample
-this allows us to use ALL low redshift galaxies (higher z lenses!)
-well-studied luminosity functions = good determination of alpha for optimal weighting
-narrow redshift range, well determined by colors
-high lensing efficiency (comes from high-z)

What is an LBG?
-lyman break at 912A
-radiation shorter than this wavelength is absorbed by neutral hydrogen
-neutral hydrogen is in star-forming regions of galaxies
-LBGs are star-forming galaxies
-they are at high redshift, so the lyman break is detectable by ground or space telescopes
      -912A is far UV and would be blocked by Earth's atmosphere

What about lenses?
-use red galaxies because they have well-determined redshift
     -red sequence, algorithm

What problems could I have?
-some red galaxies are cluster members
      -high density of low-z, if they get into high-z sample=bad
      -could obscure faint sources - balrog?
-how close are neighbors?
     -will background members be magnified by neighbors?
     -does stacking get rid of this effect? (averaging)

How to select LBGs?
-Use their distinct colors
-compare galaxies to known high-z galaxies
-have another check on fluxes (g flux cutoff for example)?
-well-studied luminosity functions can give check on number density found?

What is COSMOS


What problems could I have?
-low-z galaxies have 4000A break that can look like Lyman break
-noise can cause scatter in flux space
-quasars? (low number density - calculate)

Which estimator to use?
-can calculate correlation function
     -compare with theory
     -check as function of luminosity
     -galaxy-galaxy lensing
-mu estimator
    -compare with theory
    -can use for mass mapping
    -don't need to calculate errors using jackknife or bootstrap
    

Checks
-negative correlation that is created by lensing for faint LBGs can ONLY be explained by lensing, if exists, good sign that sample is separated (hild et al 2009b discussion)

#Cosmology
-w
-power spectra
-omega matter, sigma 8

#Dark Energy


#Weak Lensing
-shear
-shear vs mag S/N,
       -shear has 0 expectation value, multiplicative bias
       -can't measure shapes well at high z
-using it to study dark energy

#Magnification

#Dark Energy Survey

#Lyman Break Galaxies


plots/calculations I can make:
-S/N of magnification as functions of:
     -lens and source redshifts
     -lens mass
     -distance from lens

-number density of lenses and srcs

-number densities of possible interlopers
	-stars
	-quasars

-luminosity function of chosen srcs
	-compare to theory of LBGs

-Nsrc as function of distance from lens
      	-for different annuli widths


for group separation using COSMOS:
    -calculating P(group|data)
    	- how to determine group? buffers in redshift?
	  -how wide are z groups? right up against each other?
	  -do i need to do this for each lens?
	      -lens redshifts will range from 0.2-0.8

    -what will be my cutoff for P(group|data)?
    	  -will this be a combination of all three P(groups)?
	  -or just cutoff on single group P?
	  -some other checks on groups
	  	-photo-z from photo-z groups? (BAD AT HIGH-z, but maybe for interloper groups)
		-check on fluxes? (for example g MUST BE < r,i,z,Y or below some cutoff completely (depends on noise))
		-check it is in previously calculated (Davies et al 13 was it?) color space

    -can I calculate level of contamination from other groups?
    	 -use Balrog to see how fluxes of each group change?
	      -in other words, maybe do P determination on truth groups, then P on detected groups, calculate fractions on each
	      	  -only on detected ones?

    -can use Balrog to weight number densities in each annulus depending on ability to detect them on patch of sky
    	 -depends on flux?
	 -

    -estimator


problems?
	-if use BFD fluxes, how does Balrog usage change
	    -detection still ok, but change in measured flux not helpful?
	    -BFD uses fixed aperture, SE does not -well, maybe can use fixed aperture fluxes from SE? aren't they reported?

BFD approach
    -uses fluxes instead of number densities


today:
write out estimator with own math, does this depend on magnitude
what is measurement and can you account for varying survey depth and contamination
