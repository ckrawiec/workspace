Why do I care?

Dark energy is one of the great mysteries of the universe
What is it?
-the universe is accelerating and we do not know why
-cosmological constant
How can we learn about dark energy?
-growth of structure over time
-w

How can we measure evolution of matter?
-mass distribution of dark matter halos
-use gravitational lensing to measure masses
-using different redshift bins can give tomography
-correlation functions carry information about?
	     -matter density power spectrum (references??)

What else can we learn?
-cosmology from correlation functions
-galaxy bias?

How does lensing work?
-surface brightness is conserved 
-deflection described by null geodesics
-weak lens if potential/c^2 <<1
-the distortion of images is described by a jacobian matrix
-convergence (isotropic) and shear matrix (anisotropic)

How to measure mass from lensing?
-surface mass density
	 -projected mass along line of sight
-shear (read some shear papers)
-kappa from magnification
-for WL most galaxies have bulge fractions < 0.5

What is shear?
-systematics: PSF anisotropy
-shape distortions
-ellipticity distribution has rms 0.3-0.4 (B. Casaponsa et al 2013)
-reduced shear = gamma/(1-kappa), this represents the shape change while ignoring size
-reduced shear is invariant under transformation of distortion matrix by scalar multiple (mass-sheet degeneracy)

What is magnification?
-quanitified by inverse of determinant of jacobian mu=1/detA
-eigenvalues of M=A^-1 matrix (tangential and radial mu) become infinite at critical lines (lens plane), which correspond to caustics (source plane)
-in the limit of the whole sky <mu>=1
-lensing changes source flux and size
	 -competing factors: depending on flux, can be brighter but less numerous
	 -possible for effects to cancel out
-number of sources at given flux is changed
	-observed luminosity function depends on slope of intrinsic luminosity function


Shear vs. Magnification
-magnification provides a cross-check to shear because they have different systematics (PSF anisotropy vs. photometric calibrations)
-magnification can probe higher redshifts than shear (check)
-# of source galaxies with accurate magnitudes and photo-zs is greater than # of sources with accurate shapes, but magnification measurements less powerful for given sample
-dependence on redshift for cosmological constraints is different for magnitude and shear
-magnification is now possible because of deeper surveys and stable photometry
-ellipticity distribution has rms 0.3-0.4, size distribution is log-normal with sigma*ln R ~ 0.3 (bright) ~ 0.5 (faint) where R is Petrosian half light radius (B. Casaponsa et al 2013)
-need large sample to overcome intrinsic scatter
-need consistently small PSF that does not destroy size info (BCas13)
-magnification and distortion have different radial dependencies on spatial distriubtion of matter - lift mass-sheet degeneracy (BCas13)
-this can reduce uncertainties on reconstruction of distribution of matter
-power spectrum of (mu-1) is 4*P_k(l) therefore cosmological constraints could be made independent of shear (BCas13)
-constraints on sigma8 + omega_M can be improved by ~40% using magnification (vanW10)


What should we use as lenses and sources?
-Want cleanly separated samples
      -no physical correlations, only lensing
-want a large sample so S/N is good

Why use LBGs?
-the lyman break makes these galaxies easier to select
-very high redshift (z>4)
-will be cleanly separated from lens sample
-this allows us to use ALL low redshift galaxies (higher z lenses!)
-well-studied luminosity functions = good determination of alpha for optimal weighting
-narrow redshift range, well determined by colors
-high lensing efficiency (comes from high-z)
-LBGs can be used for DM halo studies (clustering)

What is an LBG?
-lyman break at 912A
-radiation shorter than this wavelength is absorbed by neutral hydrogen
-neutral hydrogen is in star-forming regions of galaxies
-LBGs are star-forming galaxies
-they are at high redshift, so the lyman break is detectable by ground or space telescopes
      -912A is far UV and would be blocked by Earth's atmosphere

What about lenses?
-use red galaxies because they have well-determined redshift
     -red sequence, algorithm

What problems could I have?
-some red galaxies are cluster members
      -high density of low-z, if they get into high-z sample=bad
      -could obscure faint sources - balrog?
-how close are neighbors?
     -will background members be magnified by neighbors?
     -does stacking get rid of this effect? (averaging)

Systematics?
-errors in magnitude/flux measurement
	-accuracy for faint objects
-local seeing can produce variation in apparent galaxy density
-dust extinction - could be subdominant to signal
-redshift overlap (shouldn't be a problem here)
-estimation of density of faint sources around bright extended objects can be biased; induced by uncertainties in sky subtractions (Mandelbaum et al 2005) -> mask
-obscuration

How to select LBGs?
-Use their distinct colors
     -u-dropouts = z>3
     -g-dropouts = z>4
     -r-dropouts = z>5
-compare galaxies to known high-z galaxies
-have another check on fluxes (g flux cutoff for example)?
-well-studied luminosity functions can give check on number density found?

What is COSMOS?


What problems could I have?
-low-z galaxies have 4000A break (old ones, from heavy metal absorption) that can look like Lyman break
-noise can cause scatter in flux space
-quasars? (low number density - calculate)
-for classic alpha(magnitude) way, our window in magnitude is so small, it would not vary

Which estimator to use?
-can calculate correlation function
     -compare with theory
     -check as function of luminosity
     -galaxy-galaxy lensing
-mu estimator
    -compare with theory
    -can use for mass mapping
    -don't need to calculate errors using jackknife or bootstrap
    

Checks
-negative correlation that is created by lensing for faint LBGs can ONLY be explained by lensing, if exists, good sign that sample is separated (hild et al 2009b discussion)

#Cosmology
-w
-power spectra
-omega matter, sigma 8

#Dark Energy


#Weak Lensing
-shear
-shear vs mag S/N,
       -shear has 0 expectation value, multiplicative bias
       -can't measure shapes well at high z
-using it to study dark energy

#Magnification

#Dark Energy Survey

#Lyman Break Galaxies


plots/calculations I can make:
-S/N of magnification as functions of:
     -lens and source redshifts
     -lens mass
     -distance from lens

-number density of lenses and srcs

-number densities of possible interlopers
	-stars
	-quasars

-luminosity function of chosen srcs
	-compare to theory of LBGs

-Nsrc as function of distance from lens
      	-for different annuli widths


for group separation using COSMOS:
    -calculating P(group|data)
    	- how to determine group? buffers in redshift?
	  -how wide are z groups? right up against each other?
	  -do i need to do this for each lens?
	      -lens redshifts will range from 0.2-0.8

    -what will be my cutoff for P(group|data)?
    	  -will this be a combination of all three P(groups)?
	  -or just cutoff on single group P?
	  -some other checks on groups
	  	-photo-z from photo-z groups? (BAD AT HIGH-z, but maybe for interloper groups)
		-check on fluxes? (for example g MUST BE < r,i,z,Y or below some cutoff completely (depends on noise))
		-check it is in previously calculated (Davies et al 13 was it?) color space

    -can I calculate level of contamination from other groups?
    	 -use Balrog to see how fluxes of each group change?
	      -in other words, maybe do P determination on truth groups, then P on detected groups, calculate fractions on each
	      	  -only on detected ones?

    -can use Balrog to weight number densities in each annulus depending on ability to detect them on patch of sky
    	 -depends on flux?
	 -

    -estimator


problems?
	-if use BFD fluxes, how does Balrog usage change
	    -detection still ok, but change in measured flux not helpful?
	    -BFD uses fixed aperture, SE does not -well, maybe can use fixed aperture fluxes from SE? aren't they reported?

BFD approach
    -uses fluxes instead of number densities
