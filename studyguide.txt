Why do I care?

Dark energy is one of the great mysteries of the universe
What is it?
-the universe is accelerating and we do not know why
-cosmological constant
How can we learn about dark energy?
-growth of structure over time
-w

How can we measure evolution of matter?
-mass distribution of dark matter halos
-use gravitational lensing to measure masses
-using different redshift bins can give tomography
-correlation functions carry information about?
	     -matter density power spectrum (references??)

What else can we learn?
-cosmology from correlation functions
-galaxy bias?

How does lensing work?
-surface brightness is conserved 
-deflection described by null geodesics
-weak lens if potential/c^2 <<1
-the distortion of images is described by a jacobian matrix
-convergence (isotropic) and shear matrix (anisotropic)

How to measure mass from lensing?
-surface mass density
	 -projected mass along line of sight
-shear (read some shear papers)
-kappa from magnification
-for WL most galaxies have bulge fractions < 0.5

What is shear?
-systematics: PSF anisotropy
-shape distortions
-ellipticity distribution has rms 0.3-0.4 (B. Casaponsa et al 2013)
-reduced shear = gamma/(1-kappa), this represents the shape change while ignoring size
-reduced shear is invariant under transformation of distortion matrix by scalar multiple (mass-sheet degeneracy)

What is magnification?
-quanitified by inverse of determinant of jacobian mu=1/detA
-eigenvalues of M=A^-1 matrix (tangential and radial mu) become infinite at critical lines (lens plane), which correspond to caustics (source plane)
-in the limit of the whole sky <mu>=1
-lensing changes source flux and size
	 -competing factors: depending on flux, can be brighter but less numerous
	 -possible for effects to cancel out
-number of sources at given flux is changed
	-observed luminosity function depends on slope of intrinsic luminosity function
	-"magnification bias" = amplification that is function of
	(quasar) magnitude and dilution effect that is constant
	regardless of magnitude (Scranton05)
	-(using mu=1+2kappa approx.), cross-correlation between magnification & foreground matter
	overdensity can be easily computed as function of matter power
	spectrum (Scranton05)
		 -signal can be separated into
		 [alpha(m)-1]*w_0(theta), where w0 contains all info
		 about nonlinear galaxy biasing and z dists (includes
		 galaxy-dark matter cross-power spectrum) (Scranton05)
	
Shear vs. Magnification
-magnification provides a cross-check to shear because they have different systematics (PSF anisotropy vs. photometric calibrations)
-magnification can probe higher redshifts than shear (check) -
magnification does not need resolved galaxies (just magnitude, not
shape) very hard to measure shape of galaxies with z>1 from
ground-based data(Hild 11)
-# of source galaxies with accurate magnitudes and photo-zs is greater than # of sources with accurate shapes, but magnification measurements less powerful for given sample
-dependence on redshift for cosmological constraints is different for magnitude and shear
-magnification is now possible because of deeper surveys and stable photometry
-ellipticity distribution has rms 0.3-0.4, size distribution is log-normal with sigma*ln R ~ 0.3 (bright) ~ 0.5 (faint) where R is Petrosian half light radius (B. Casaponsa et al 2013)
-need large sample to overcome intrinsic scatter
-need consistently small PSF that does not destroy size info (BCas13)
-magnification and distortion have different radial dependencies on spatial distriubtion of matter - lift mass-sheet degeneracy (BCas13)
-this can reduce uncertainties on reconstruction of distribution of matter
-power spectrum of (mu-1) is 4*P_k(l) therefore cosmological constraints could be made independent of shear (BCas13)
-constraints on sigma8 + omega_M can be improved by ~40% using magnification (vanW10)
-size magnification - sizes usually come for free with shear measurements
-magnification S/N typically lower for magnification than shear, but
this can depend on the slope of background number counts - beneficial
to choose steep slope (Hild 11)
-ellipticities can be assumed to be intrinsically randomly
distributed, but intrinsic distribution of fluxes has to be measured
from data by averaging over large areas of sky (Hild 09)

What should we use as lenses and sources?
-Want cleanly separated samples
      -no physical correlations, only lensing
-want a large sample so S/N is good

Why use LBGs?
-the lyman break makes these galaxies easier to select
-very high redshift (z>4)
-will be cleanly separated from lens sample
-this allows us to use ALL low redshift galaxies (higher z lenses!)
-well-studied luminosity functions = good determination of alpha for optimal weighting
-narrow redshift range, well determined by colors
-high lensing efficiency (comes from high-z)
-LBGs can be used for DM halo studies (clustering)
-much higher surface density on the sky than quasars (hild 09)

What is an LBG?
-lyman break at 912A
-radiation shorter than this wavelength is absorbed by neutral hydrogen
-neutral hydrogen is in star-forming regions of galaxies
-LBGs are star-forming galaxies
-they are at high redshift, so the lyman break is detectable by ground or space telescopes
      -912A is far UV and would be blocked by Earth's atmosphere
-different contributions to absorption (Meiksin 2009)
	-Ly-alpha forest absorbers (NHI < 10^17/cm^2) = most common
	-Lyman Limit Systems (10^17<NHI<10^20) = dense enough to
	absorb photons above lyman limit (photoelectric edge)
	-Damped Ly-alpha absorbers (NHI>10^20) = rarest, most easily
	identifiable in spectra
	-two main effects for attentuation of distant light source are
	photoelectric absorption by LLSs and optically thin IGM and
	resonance line scattering by the Lyalpha forest (IGMtrans2011)
	-additional contributions from intervening metal systems and
	helium (discrete and clumpy, predict mean amount and model
	statistical fluctutions - IGMtrans2011)

What about lenses?
-use red galaxies because they have well-determined redshift
     -red sequence, algorithm

What problems could I have?
-some red galaxies are cluster members
      -high density of low-z, if they get into high-z sample=bad
      -could obscure faint sources - balrog?
-how close are neighbors?
     -will background members be magnified by neighbors?
     -does stacking get rid of this effect? (averaging)

Data
-MAGAUTO = flux (counts) measured in an elliptical aperture, provides estimation of total magnitude of the object
-MAGDETMODEL measured from the shape (a Sersic profile model) fit to the object in the SExtractor detection image (either r or i band for SV (from photoz paper)) and the flux is measured separately in each band using same model shape
-MAGMODEL fit the shape of the object independently in each of the bands
-MAGDETMODEL in general better suited for color measurement and hence more appropriate to use for photoz estimation (sanchez et al 2014 photoz paper)
-use matching radius of 1 arcsec (same as sanchez et al)
-Redmagic Y1a1 star/galaxy done with modes class, therefore expect significant stellar contamination at 0.7<z<0.8 where stellar locus comes close to red sequence


Systematics?
-large PSFs remove size information (multiplicative bias - larger than for shear BCas13)
-errors in magnitude/flux measurement
	-accuracy for faint objects
-local seeing can produce variation in apparent galaxy density
-dust extinction - could be subdominant to signal
-redshift overlap (shouldn't be a problem here) (intrinsic clustering
has much larger signal than lensing)
-estimation of density of faint sources around bright extended objects can be biased; induced by uncertainties in sky subtractions (Mandelbaum et al 2005) -> mask
-obscuration
-things that can effect observed source density (Scranton05)
	-seeing variations
	-masks around bright stars
	-sky background subtraction problems around bright galaxies
	-photometric accuracy - incompleteness can look like signal on
	small scales

How to select LBGs?
-Use their distinct colors
     -u-dropouts = z>3
     -g-dropouts = z>4
     -r-dropouts = z>5
-compare galaxies to known high-z galaxies
-have another check on fluxes (g flux cutoff for example)?
-well-studied luminosity functions can give check on number density found?

Using templates?
-Davies et al 2013 paper created some templates in DES to see if DES
will find high mass high redshift galaxies
     -used Maraston's templates
-I was using Bruzual & Charlot's GALAXEV code to try and make some red
galaxy templates and LBG templates
       -from paper (BC2003): ages between 10^5 and 2e10 yr, hi (3A, 3200-9500A)
       and low (91A-160micron) resolution spectra available
       	   -old technique was to reproduce spectrum as linear
	   combination of individual stellar spectra
	   -new technique "isochrone synthesis": expand star formation
	   history in series of SSPs, uses stellar evolutionary tracks
	   to interpolate isochrone, sum starts defining isochrone at
	   age t and metallicity, use stellar spectral library to
	   assigna individual stars along isochrone
	   -chabrier (physically motivated, fits low mass and brown
	   dwarfs) or salpeter imf
	   -SED is normed to total mass of 1 solar mass in stars at
	   age t=0
	   -Padova 1994 or 2000 evolutionary tracks
       -can tune metallicity (6 options), star formation history (SSP,
       burst, Exp), age
       -can make composite stellar pops, add dust
       -get spectra, redshifted myself, because the csp outputs were
       confusing
       -tricky things: mass normalization, evolved magnitudes or not
-Ezgal is a useful tool for using different template sets
       -python
       -gets rid of having to deal with the trickiness yourself
       -can add SF, dust laws, or spectra yourself
       -from paper (Mancone and Gonzalez 2012)
              -allows comparison of different model sets so that uncertainty
       	      can be quantified
       	      -interpolate between metallicities
      	      -BC2003/updated, Maraston, BaSTI, FSPS models
      	      -models agree best in the optical for old, solar metallicity
      	      models, differences at the ~0.1 mag level
       	      -most problematic for ages <2Gyr and lambda > 7500A
	      (TP-ABGs important), scatter here vary from 0.3 to 0.7
	      mags -> redshift dependent model uncertainty    
	      -e-corrections specify amount of observed magnitude
	      evolution due to aging of stellar pop
	      -k-corrections specify amount of evolution due to
	      observing a different part of the SED at different
	      redshifts
	      -e+k-corrections and distance moduli specify the
	      magnitude evolution of a stellar popuation as function
	      of redshift
	      -can use any cosmology
	      -calculates stellar masses
	      -extended star formation history smooths out scatter
	      between models as function of age
	      -TP-AGB stars can dominate light at long wavelengths and
	      ages > 10^8 yrs, but mass loss not understood
	      theoretically, unkown metallicities typically
	      -scatter between models typically same or smaller for
	      sub-solar metallicity b/c all these model sets compared
	      or calibrated to match MW globular clusters, old and
	      metal poor systems
	      -for 3.6 microns, model scatter peaks in 1<z<3 range
	      	   peak in models caused by uncertainty in modeling
		   young stellar pops blueward of 4000A bbreak
	      -uncertainties in SPS modeling depend sensitively on
	      wavelength and age
	      -lower limit on uncertainties because does not include
	      systematic errors in assumptions or methodologies that
	      are shared between all model sets
-Adding attenuation by neutral hydrogen is the key to modelling LBGs.
	-there are models from Madau (1995) and Meiksin (2006) which I
	had trouble figuring out to implement on my own.
	-people (Inoue & Iwata 2008, IGMtransmission - Harrison,
	Meiksin, Stock 2011) have used monte carlo simulations to
	model the absorption
	-IGMtransmission
		-java gui
		-monte carlo sims over many lines or site, each color
		independently or average
		-a population of discrete, lyman limit systems are
		drawn from dN/dz and dN/dtauL distributions placed
		along random lines of sight and total contribution to
		intergalactic transmission function calculated
		(default or Inoue & Iwata LLS dist)
		-includes mean contributions to opacity due to
		ly-alpha forest and photoelectric absorption of
		optically thin IGM
		-LLSs number drawn from Poisson, each LLS random
		value of z and tauL from dists

 the ESO Deep Publis Survey" Hildebrandt et al 2006


How to measure magnification?
-cross-correlation of lenses and sources, amplitude depends on
magnitude cuts of sources
-magnification estimate from counting sources and comparing to
-Huff & Graves 2011:
      -tight scaling relation between galaxy properties that are
      modified by gravitational lensing and other properties that are
      not
      -ellipticities induced by lensing are small (~1%) compared to
      intrinsic (~30%) but intrinsic variance in distribution of
      galaxy sizes and luminosities much larger than shapes
      -photometric fundamental plane: effective radius (Re), surface
      brightness, and stellar velocity dispersion (fundamental plane), but dispersion hard
      to measure, use concentration instead (both correlated with
      galaxy mass, correlated with each other)
      -select sample of early type background galaxies that should lie
      on the photoFP
      -SDSS petrosian concentration C=R90/R50
      -Re is hlr of best fit deVauc profile
      -fit photoFP separately in each deltaz=0.01 bin, 35% dispersion
      in Re direction

Previous Measurements?
-"Detection of cosmic magnification with SDSS" Scranton et al 2005
    -8sigma detection
    -3800 sq deg, ~200k quasars, 13million galaxies
    -quasars because large z-range and large z-segregation
    -found excess of bright (g <~9) quasars & deficit of fainter ones
    around galaxies
    -for the first time, amplitude & angular dependence were found to
    be in agreement with theory
    -use range of quasar magnitudes, average <alpha-1>
    -lensing kernel is function of lens&source redshifts, so fit z
    dists to both samples
    -quasars in 1<photo-z<2.2 range
    -fit simple HOD instead of evolving one (b/c small angular bins in
    nonlinear regime of gravitational collapse) to calculate
    matter-galaxy power spectrum
    -DR3, 1.4" seeing limit, 0.2 extinction limit in r
    -1 gal/sq arcmin
    -petrosian magnitudes can see ~25% variation in gal density with
    seeing for magnitude limited sample
    -quasar data set generated using KDE (Richards et al 2004) -> colors for each new object
    compared to those of each object in quasar/star training sets (in
    4-d color space), binary class according to which has larger
    probability of membership
    -pair-based estimator similar to Landy-Szalay but modified for
    cross-crelation
    -30 jackknife samples to generate errors
    -used optimally (alpha-1) weighted correlation function

-"CARS: The CFHTLS-Archive-Research Survey III. First detection of
 cosmic magnification in samples of normal high-z galaxies"
 Hildebrandt, van Waerbeke, and Erben 2009
 	      ->80k LBG candidates with z=2.5-5 selected from Deep
 part of CFHTLS
      -Data from CFHTLS-Deep Survey, ugriz, four independent fields of
 1 sq deg each
   -sims set up to identify regions in 2-color-space where high-z
 sources can be selected with high efficiency and low contamination
 	 -34k u-dropouts (z~3.2) 36k g-dropouts (z~3.8), 10k
 r-dropouts, z~4.7
 	     -g-dropouts contaminated by small frac (4%) of low-z gals
 with redshifts 0<z<0.5
      -r-dropouts contam. by 0.5<z<1.0 (2.5%)
      -(know redshifts of possible contaminants - do they mean 4000A
 break?)
	-incompleteness at faint end prevents measurement of slope of
 # counts -> can use external LBG-LF that has been corrected for
 incompleteness
	-otherwise, measurements agree with external LF's
	-foreground sample selected with photo-z's, BPZ
	-intervals [0.1,1.0],[0.5,1.4],[0.1,0.5]U[1.0,1.4]
	-modified Landy & Szalay
	-halos of bright stars & low-S/N regions masked -> loss of 30%
 area but highly uniform dataset with homog. det. and sel. efficiency
	-sources are weighted by alpha-1 according to expectation from
 LF
	-cross-correlation is estimated separately for each of 4
 fields, calc the mean
 	 -draw 10 jack-knife samples
	 -magnitude bins chosen to show pos and neg correlations, see
 negative correlation that cannot be from redshift overlap
 	  -signal is underestimated by the theory
	  -good qualitative agreement with predictions
 

What is COSMOS?



What problems could I have?
-low-z galaxies have 4000A break (old ones, from heavy metal absorption) that can look like Lyman break
-noise can cause scatter in flux space
-quasars? (low number density - calculate)
-for classic alpha(magnitude) way, our window in magnitude is so small, it would not vary

Which estimator to use?
-can calculate correlation function
     -compare with theory
     -check as function of luminosity
     -galaxy-galaxy lensing
-mu estimator
    -compare with theory
    -can use for mass mapping
    -don't need to calculate errors using jackknife or bootstrap
    

Checks
-negative correlation that is created by lensing for faint LBGs can ONLY be explained by lensing, if exists, good sign that sample is separated (hild et al 2009b discussion)

#Cosmology
-w
-power spectra
-omega matter, sigma 8

#Dark Energy


#Weak Lensing
-shear
-shear vs mag S/N,
       -shear has 0 expectation value, multiplicative bias
       -can't measure shapes well at high z
-using it to study dark energy

#Magnification

#Dark Energy Survey

#Lyman Break Galaxies


plots/calculations I can make:
-S/N of magnification as functions of:
     -lens and source redshifts
     -lens mass
     -distance from lens

-number density of lenses and srcs

-number densities of possible interlopers
	-stars
	-quasars

-luminosity function of chosen srcs
	-compare to theory of LBGs

-Nsrc as function of distance from lens
      	-for different annuli widths


for group separation using COSMOS:
    -calculating P(group|data)
    	- how to determine group? buffers in redshift?
	  -how wide are z groups? right up against each other?
	  -do i need to do this for each lens?
	      -lens redshifts will range from 0.2-0.8

    -what will be my cutoff for P(group|data)?
    	  -will this be a combination of all three P(groups)?
	  -or just cutoff on single group P?
	  -some other checks on groups
	  	-photo-z from photo-z groups? (BAD AT HIGH-z, but maybe for interloper groups)
		-check on fluxes? (for example g MUST BE < r,i,z,Y or below some cutoff completely (depends on noise))
		-check it is in previously calculated (Davies et al 13 was it?) color space

    -can I calculate level of contamination from other groups?
    	 -use Balrog to see how fluxes of each group change?
	      -in other words, maybe do P determination on truth groups, then P on detected groups, calculate fractions on each
	      	  -only on detected ones?

    -can use Balrog to weight number densities in each annulus depending on ability to detect them on patch of sky
    	 -depends on flux?
	 -

    -estimator


problems?
	-if use BFD fluxes, how does Balrog usage change
	    -detection still ok, but change in measured flux not helpful?
	    -BFD uses fixed aperture, SE does not -well, maybe can use fixed aperture fluxes from SE? aren't they reported?
	-Balrog Y1A1 does not appear to cover whole footprint - could
	use SV instead...?
	
BFD approach
    -uses fluxes instead of number densities

Questions:
-what are "coherent" shears and magnifications
-lensing kernel (function of lens/source redshifts) what pieces
exactly
-Manuel's magnification paper-> how calculate w0(theta)? (power spec)
